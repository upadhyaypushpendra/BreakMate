## Description

BreakMate is a cross-platform desktop application built with Electron and Svelte that helps protect your eyes and boost productivity through smart break reminders. The app runs in your system tray and intelligently reminds you to take breaks, preventing eye strain, poor posture, and burnout.[2][1]

### Key Features

- **Customizable Break Intervals**: Set your own work-rest rhythm with frequent short breaks and occasional longer breaks[1]
- **Smart Break Detection**: Automatically pauses during meetings, video playback, screen sharing, and gaming[2]
- **Wellness Reminders**: Get notified to blink, stretch, and maintain proper posture throughout the day[1]
- **Idle-Time Detection**: Only reminds you when you're actively working, not when you're away[2]
- **Pre-Break Notifications**: Gentle warnings before breaks so you can wrap up tasks smoothly[1]
- **Lightweight & Private**: All processing happens locally on your machine[3]

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Node.js**: Version 20 or higher[4]
- **npm**: Comes with Node.js (or yarn/pnpm as alternatives)[4]
- **Git**: For cloning the repository

### Platform-Specific Requirements

- **macOS**: macOS 10.13 or higher
- **Windows**: Windows 10 or higher

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/breakmate.git
cd breakmate
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

All required dependencies are listed in `package.json` and will be installed automatically.[4]

## Testing Locally

### Development Mode

To run the app in development mode with hot-reload:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This command runs both the Svelte renderer and Electron main process concurrently. The renderer will be available at `http://localhost:5173` before launching the Electron window.[4]

### Alternative Development Commands

- **Run renderer only** (for UI development):

```bash
npm run dev:renderer
```

- **Run main process only**:

```bash
npm run dev:main
```

- **Start with Electron Forge**:

```bash
npm start
```

This launches the app using electron-forge without the development server.[4]

## Building the App

### Build for Development

To compile TypeScript and build the renderer:

```bash
npm run build
```

This runs both `build:main` and `build:renderer` scripts.[4]

### Create Distributables

#### Build for Your Current Platform

To package the app and create platform-specific distributables:

```bash
npm run make
```

This command uses Electron Forge to:

1. Package your app code with the Electron binary[5][6]
2. Create distributables for your current platform (`.exe` for Windows, `.app` for macOS)[5]

Distributables will be generated in the `out/make/` directory.[7][6]

#### Build for macOS (Multiple Options)

Build for your current Mac architecture:

```bash
npm run build:mac
```

Build specifically for Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3):

```bash
npm run build:mac:arm64
```

Build for Intel Macs:

```bash
npm run build:mac:x64
```

Build Universal binary (works on both Intel and Apple Silicon):

```bash
npm run build:mac:universal
```

**Note:** Universal builds are larger in size but work on both architectures.

### Package Only (Without Creating Distributables)

To create a packaged app without generating distributables:

```bash
npm run package
```

For macOS packaging only:

```bash
npm run package:mac
```

The packaged app will be in the `out/` folder.[5][4]

### Output Locations

After building, you'll find:

- **Packaged apps**: `out/<app-name>-darwin-arm64/` (or x64/universal)
- **Distributables**: `out/make/` (ZIP files for macOS)
- **Compiled code**: `dist/` directory
